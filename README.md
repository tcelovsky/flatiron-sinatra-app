This is a Sinatra MVC app that uses ActiveRecord. This app scrapes the events page of the American Museum of Natural History and allows the users to save the events they are interested in. The users can log in, log out, view and edit the events they save. Users cannot view other users' events and cannot edit or delete other users' events.
